            <p class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Problem:</strong>
              With over 250 Afghan women refugee students at MJC, many 
              of whom are new arrivals, it is important for students to be able to access 
              resources and linguistically and culturally-relevant support to address 
              pressing barriers to education and their own engagement in the 
              community. </p>
            <P class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Solution:</strong>
              To this end, the MJC hambastagi zanan (meaning 'women 
              united' in Dari) was begun by recently-arrived Afghan women students. 
              Drawing on the cultural institution of women's associations to encourage 
              women to gather, share resources, build community, and find solutions 
              to collective struggles, the hambastagi zanan met regularly over fall and 
              spring semesters. During these gatherings, women hambastagi leaders 
              brought in community and college guests to share financial, legal, 
              entrepreneurial, and academic resources. Identifying the need to 
              network, the women have worked with the founders of a community 
              networking app, Abule, to make it more linguistically relevant to Afghan 
              women. The women also identified the lack of access to driving education 
              as a major barrier to engaging fully in school and the community. To that 
              end, the women organized a series of English for Driving workshops with 
              the possibility of receiving free behind-the-wheel driving lessons from 
              local driving schools.
