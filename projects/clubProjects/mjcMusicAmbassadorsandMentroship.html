            <p class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Problem:</strong>:
              Lack of access to music instruction, instruments, and private 
              instruction in areas of music that are of most interest to community 
              youth; and lack of opportunities to explore and become knowledgeable 
              about possible educational & career paths in music.</p>
            <P class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Solution:</strong>
              We have developed partnerships and collaborations with 
              several non-profits and local businesses to provide music education, 
              music therapy services, performance opportunities, and event 
              organization and support to those in the community who have limited 
              access to these resources. The community benefits from the increased 
              presence and interaction with music and the arts and our students get 
              the professional experience as music educators, music therapists and 
              various roles in music technology and industry. This exploration will help 
              them clarify their educational and career goals.
