            <p class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Problem:</strong>The Shower Shuttle, the mobile shower service that brings hot 
                showers to the regionâ€™s homeless population had an issue with their 
                shampoo dispensers. The lids were being bumped off during use and 
                cracking after hitting the floor of the shower. The lids are not available 
                individually, so it was necessary to purchase new dispensers each time a 
                lid cracked. Dean Dodd, founder of the Shower Shuttle, approached 
                Professor Deborah Gilbert about the problem who mentioned it to 
                Jeremy Wilson, professor of Engineering.</p>
            <P class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Solution:</strong> : Professor Wilson brought the problem to the students of his 
                Intro to Engineering course. Each of the students designed a replacement 
                lid in Fusion 360, a 3D design program for mechanical parts. In early 
                2023, the first prototype was 3D printed and delivered for trial use. The 
                MJC Innovation Center will continue to provide 3D printed lids as needed 
                for the Shower Shuttle</p>
