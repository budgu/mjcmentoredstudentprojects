              The Youth Empowerment Project addresses the school to 
              prison pipeline in West Modesto.</p>
            <P class="paragraph-margin"><strong>Solution:</strong>
              The college has a role to play in the community through 
              interrupting the current school-to-prison pipeline for its most at-promise 
              youth and providing them with a new vision for their future. The college 
              has an opportunity to support a fledgling non-profit in its work by 
              providing free activities to youth in the Legacy After-School Program once 
              a week with the goals of:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>connecting with and welcoming community youth to the college and in </li>
              <li>building youth confidence by exposing youth to a college campus and making higher education feel more accessible</li>
              <li>personally connecting future scholars with faculty, staff, and current students through relational experiences</li>
              <li>introducing youth to educational pathways, resources, and programs</li>
              <li> providing at-promise youth with a vision for the future</li>
              <li> developing creativity, stimulating curiosity, and igniting passion for learning through experiential activities at the college with caring professionals</li>
